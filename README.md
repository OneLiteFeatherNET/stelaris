# Stelaris UI

The Stelaris project is primarily aimed at facilitating the creation of various models, which are
subsequently translated into programming code. Model creation is facilitated through a user
interface (UI) developed using Flutter. Within this UI, a variety of widgets are available to aid in
model creation. Each model can be customized with different data, depending on its specific context.
Models that can be created are items, fonts, attributes and notifications. Each model has its 
own page within the UI, where the user can create, edit, and delete models. The sides 
may be divided into multiple parts. In the build page the user can generate the code.
